Object Oriented Programming - 

Object oriented Design - 

Class and Object >> 

Class : 
main method >> this class can be run as a java application - Traditional programming concept 

no main method >> class - code reusuability - block of code - 

class you create in java - is actually datatype - reference datatype 

int, String, double - primary datatype 

WebElement - reference datatype 

Class : prototype or design of a system 

2 components : 
what the system can do - method/functions
what are the atributes or properties of the system - 

static >> if a component is part of object or class 

method overloading: two or multiple methods implemented with different parameters 

constructor: executes as soon as an object is created 

constructor overloading: multiple constructor with different parameters 



Inside one class >> 

class
object
properties
methods 
method overloading
constructor
constructor overloading
static 

Relationship between multiple 

inheritance - two classes - properties and method
parent class - super class
child class - sub class 

method overriding >> happens between multiple classes with child and parent relationship - if subclass or childclass has the same function as parent/ super class , childclass object has to use its own functions 

super keyword: super keyword is used by childclass to access parent class function or constuctor


abstract class >> if a class is abstract class, we can not create any object of the class - so the way to use this class is to create a child class and child class object will get everything from parent class 


interface: is an outline of methods or properties those can be implemented by different classes 

difference between abstract class and interface: 

WebDriver driver = new Chromedriver();



webdriver driver = new chromedriver(); 

WebDriver is an interface
