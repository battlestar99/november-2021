Homework 

what is computer program? 

set of instructions that we can give to the computer to execute some specific tasks 

how we give instructions to the computer is through the programming language 

java C C# python javascript 

what are the basic concepts and what we are going to learn? 

problem-solution 

1. how we can store data in a computer - how to store data, use them and 
manage them

you dont have car 

do you have money to buy a car >> yes/no
how much money you have >> number 
is it worth buying a car >> train journey , buy if/else 
how far is your work from home
what are the usage of the car >> 

data 

2. conditional statements >>if/else

3. doing the same steps again >> looping, for/while

4. data structure >> arrary

5. Functions or methods >> write a re-usuable block of code

6. Object oriented programming 

Key learning 1: How to start using eclipse to write our java code 

Basic unit of java >> 

class add main method 

main method >> starting point of java code 

scope >> { }, class methods conditional statment looping
{ staring point
} ending point 

source code >> the code written by you or the programming you are working with 

library code >> which code are already written you can use them 

package are just java folder
main() {


}

main method 

How to store data in our program? 

12 
100 
123.56
Mike

datatype of java - variable 

integer >> whole number 45
double >> 3.45
String >> set of characters , mike, 10400 eaton place
boolean >> true or false 

variable 

int x
double y 
String name
boolean z 

common structure : 

datatype variablename = value ; 

int xyz = 32; 

double abc = 23.45; 

x=54;

datatype variablename = value; 

int x = 56; 

x=10;

double y = 54.76; 

storing data can happen in two steps: 

step 1: declaring a variable , declaretion 

int x; 

step 2: initiazliae the variable with a value , initiazliation

x=65;

step 1+ 2 
declaretion + initialization 
int x = 65; 

java is a case sensitive lanaguage 

a and A is different in java
x and X is different in java

datatype variablename = value; 
decalration
initialization 

int double String boolean 
how to store data in your program: 

datatype>> int, double, String, boolean
variable name>> you can give any name for your variable 
value >> what value you want to store 

datatype variablename = value; 

int x = 45; 

int x ; declaration 

 x = 45; initialize 

x = 34; 

double y = 100.10; 

String name = "john"; 

boolean flag = true; 


conditonal statement: 

if there is no rain >> true , false 
I will go florida 

if condition 

if(condition) {

// code goes here

}

if I dont get into harvard
else I will go to columbia 

and && 
or || 

(conidition1 and conidtion2) >> true

if I go to florida && I go to texas then I will go by plane 

if I go to florida or I go to texas then I will go by plane

Problem Statement: 

car monthly payment software: 

car price 
admin fee 
down payment 
tax 
title fee

apr >> credit score 


monthly payment = carprice/number of months 

100 , 6 percent tax 

106 

100 + 100*(6/100)




syntax of the code: 

datatype variablename = value; 
int x = 45; // can store only whole number 
String name = "michael"; // can store anything inside the doule quoation
double y = 56.76; // can store any decimal number
boolean z = true; // only true of false 
char c = 'a';

what we do with this data? 
car payment calculator = depended on the requirement 

number + - * /  int double float
boolean - true or false 

comparing values 

if(condition) {

}

class is a scope >> { - staring point and ending point 

method >> scope { }

java methods / functions 

1. control statment - looping - is a way to execute the same code for certain number of times based on a condition 

for loop 

if(condition) {}

for(initiazalition; condition; increament or decreament){

}

while loop 


2. data structure - array 

double y = 5; 

if(if we can login to the portal) {

print"test passed";

}




data structure >> how you organize data in your problem

int x = 10; 
x=12;

array

1. what type of data the array will be stored
2. what will be size of the array - how many data you want to store in the array 

int x; // its an integer variable

// declaretion of the array
int x []; // its an integer array 

// size of the array 

x = new int [100];

int num [] = new int [500];

array index >> starts from 0 

num[0]=343;



String name[]=new String [200];

double z [] = new double [200];




{} >> scope
() >> methods/functions
[] >> array 



list
linkedlist




arrary 

declaretion 

int x []; 

initialization 

x = new int [100];

int x ; 

x=12;

fundamental datatype - int double boolean

compound or reference datatype - array String
