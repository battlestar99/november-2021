what is computer program? 

set of instructions that we can give to the computer to execute some specific tasks 

how we give instructions to the computer is through the programming language 

java C C# python javascript 

what are the basic concepts and what we are going to learn? 

problem-solution 

1. how we can store data in a computer - how to store data, use them and 
manage them

you dont have car 

do you have money to buy a car >> yes/no
how much money you have >> number 
is it worth buying a car >> train journey , buy if/else 
how far is your work from home
what are the usage of the car >> 

data 

2. conditional statements >>if/else

3. doing the same steps again >> looping, for/while

4. data structure >> arrary

5. Functions or methods >> write a re-usuable block of code

6. Object oriented programming 

Key learning 1: How to start using eclipse to write our java code 

Basic unit of java >> 

class add main method 

main method >> starting point of java code 

scope >> { }, class methods conditional statment looping
{ staring point
} ending point 

source code >> the code written by you or the programming you are working with 

library code >> which code are already written you can use them 

package are just java folder
main() {


}

main method 

How to store data in our program?

datatype of java - variable 

integer >> whole number 45
double >> 3.45
String >> set of characters , mike, 10400 eaton place
boolean >> true or false 

variable 

int x
double y 
String name
boolean z 

common structure : 

datatype variablename = value ; 

int xyz = 32; 

double abc = 23.45; 

x=54;

datatype variablename = value; 

int x = 56; 

x=10;

double y = 54.76; 

storing data can happen in two steps: 

step 1: declaring a variable , declaretion 

int x; 

step 2: initiazliae the variable with a value , initiazliation

x=65;

step 1+ 2 
declaretion + initialization 
int x = 65; 

java is a case sensitive lanaguage 

a and A is different in java
x and X is different in java
