TestNG 

java and selenium >> 

java >> programming language 
selenium >> programming libary , java 
web based application testing 

Test scripts >> main method of java 

Testing Library  - TestNG , Cucumber 

1. code organization >> test scenario
2. pass/fail scenerio >>  
3. generating report >> 
4. 100 scripts >> test suite 
5. data driven framework >> test data seperated from test script

TestNG setup 

1. eclipse plugin - to run the TestNG test from eclipse 
2. TestNG jar file - programming library 

TestNG - annotations 

test scripts template - TestNG 

main method of java will be replaced by TestNG or cucumber 

@BeforeTest - pre requirment for the test
@Test - is the main test 
@AfterTest - post requirement for the test 

50 test scripts >> 110 test cases - test scenario 

BeforeMethod, AfterMethod

@BeforeTest
@BeforeMethod
@Test1
@AfterMethod
@BeforeMethod
@Test2 
@AfterMethod
@AfterTest

Assertions - is a way to compare expected and actual results

Assertionerror - test is failing and there is defect in the application 

no such element exception- stalement - null pointer exception - 
code is failing - we need to fixing 

Test case - Test scenario - Test script based on user story , requirement 

user story: user should be able to login with valid credentials 

user story: user should not be able to login with invalid credentials 

steps of writing test scripts: 

1. analyzing requirements or user stories 
2. coming up with test scenarios 
3. if you are manual tester - create test cases 
4. if you are automation tester - create test scripts and add test scnearios 
in the script 

steps of developing scripts: 

1. find out which scenario / s you want to add in a script 
2. find out what will be pre-requirment or post requirment of the scenarios 
3. adding @Test annotationa based on the the scnearios you want to automated 
4. if you need to execute any step before each test, consider using beforemethod and/or afteremthod 
5. with each test, must add at least one assertion - to create pass / fail scenario 
6. use page object model to find and use the webelement you need
